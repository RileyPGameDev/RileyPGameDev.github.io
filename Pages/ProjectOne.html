            <h2> About the Project</h2>
            <p> In my first year of college, I was one of the very few students hand picked to participate in work experience with Dambuster Studios, this interaction was done via IntoGames.</p>
            <p> I was put into a team with 5 other students, we had our roles that we specialised in. I was one of two programmers, we also had 2 artists and 2 3D modelers, and we were assigned a mentor to help guide us if we ever needed it.</p>
            <p> I was elected by my team as the project manager, this came with responsibilities such as:</p>
            <menu> 
                <li> Leading daily stand ups</li>
                <li> Making dificult decisions</li>
                <li> Checking up on my team and helping with any issues that came up</li>
                <li> Adjusting to my team members work style and flows</li>
                <li> Reporting back to our mentor</li>
            </menu>
            <p> Just to name a few.</p>
            <p> We had only 5 days to get this asset done, however, the first day was about idea generation, and the last day was presenting. So we only had 3 days to get the asset produced.</p>

            <h2> The End Result</h2>
            <p> Before I get into the programming behind the asset, here is a video of the finished product.</p>

            <p> In this showcase, you can see that our asset was a food stand that explodes after a delay, it then launches projectile food items that deal damage to the player and any enemies.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2> Programming the Asset</h2>
            <p> As there were 2 programmers, we split the workload between us, as seen in this image taken from our Trello Board</p>
