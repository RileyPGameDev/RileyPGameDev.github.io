## About Me
My name is Riley and I'm an aspiring game programmer and developer! 

I first got interested in Game Development at 13 years old and have been studying it ever since.

I study Games Technology in Confetti Institute of Creative Technologies and I am progressing onto University later this year (2024) to study Games Development at Staffordshire University.

My favourite game is Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice by FromSoftware.

A childhood game I remember playing was the Gears of War franchise.

I enjoy going out with friends, working out and playing games.

## Achievements 
In my 2 years of college, I have already had the pleasure of: 

Connecting with Industry Professionals; 

Being chosen for a 1 week work experience with Dambuster Studios via IntoGames (you can see the achievement on my LinkedIn page [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riley-proctor-12b695254/));

Accepting an award for my game mechanic; 

Pariticipating in a Game Jam; 

and leading a team as a project manager, including leading daily stand ups.

## Aspirations
My end goal is to work for a Triple A company and meet many amazing and talented people in the industry, as well as to push my name out there and work on big games that many people will enjoy playing.

My goals right now is to do my best in this final college project and progress onwards to University where I will hone my skills and become industry ready, and get my Bachelors degree.

An optional goal I would want to consider doing is getting my masters degree in game development!
